# 5 Most Common Phishing Attacks and How to Spot Them

Phishing attacks remain one of the most prevalent and effective cyber threats facing organizations today. Despite growing awareness, these attacks continue to evolve in sophistication, making them increasingly difficult to detect. This article explores the five most common types of phishing attacks and provides practical guidance on how to identify and defend against them.

## 1. Email Phishing

Email phishing remains the most common form of phishing attack, accounting for over 90% of all phishing attempts. These attacks typically involve sending emails that appear to come from trusted sources—banks, payment processors, popular websites, or even colleagues and executives within your organization.

### How It Works

Attackers craft emails designed to create a sense of urgency or curiosity, compelling recipients to take immediate action. Common tactics include:

- Claiming your account has been compromised and needs verification
- Alerting you to a "suspicious transaction" that needs review
- Notifying you of a "missed delivery" requiring action
- Sharing a "confidential document" that needs your attention

These emails typically contain links to fraudulent websites designed to steal credentials or malicious attachments that install malware when opened.

### How to Spot Email Phishing

Look for these warning signs:
- **Sender address discrepancies**: Carefully examine the sender's email address. Phishers often use domains that look similar to legitimate ones (e.g., amazon-support.com instead of amazon.com).
- **Generic greetings**: Legitimate organizations typically address you by name. "Dear Customer" or "Dear User" often signals a phishing attempt.
- **Poor grammar and spelling**: Professional organizations rarely send communications with obvious language errors.
- **Suspicious links**: Hover over (don't click) any links to see the actual URL. If it doesn't match the purported sender or looks unusual, it's likely fraudulent.
- **Unexpected attachments**: Be wary of unexpected attachments, especially those with extensions like .exe, .zip, or .docm.
- **Urgency or threats**: Messages creating extreme urgency or threatening negative consequences if you don't act immediately are red flags.

## 2. Spear Phishing

Unlike generic email phishing, spear phishing targets specific individuals or organizations with highly personalized messages. These attacks require more research and preparation but have significantly higher success rates.

### How It Works

Attackers gather information about their targets from social media, professional networking sites, company websites, and data breaches. They then craft messages that reference specific details—recent conferences attended, projects worked on, organizational structures, or personal interests—to establish credibility.

### How to Spot Spear Phishing

- **Excessive personalization**: While legitimate emails may include your name, spear phishing often includes unusually specific details about you or your organization to build trust.
- **Slight inconsistencies**: The attacker may get most details right but miss subtle elements of how your colleagues or partners typically communicate.
- **Unusual requests**: Be suspicious of requests that deviate from established procedures, especially those involving sensitive information or financial transactions.
- **New or changed contact information**: Attackers may provide "updated" contact information for further communication outside normal channels.

## 3. Business Email Compromise (BEC)

Business Email Compromise represents a sophisticated form of spear phishing that specifically targets businesses conducting wire transfers. According to the FBI, BEC scams have cost organizations worldwide over $43 billion between 2016 and 2023.

### How It Works

Attackers typically compromise or impersonate executive email accounts, then use these accounts to request urgent wire transfers or changes to payment information. These attacks often target finance departments or employees with financial authority.

### How to Spot BEC

- **Changes to established procedures**: Be wary of emails requesting deviations from standard financial protocols.
- **New payment details**: Requests to update vendor payment information or wire money to new accounts should trigger immediate verification.
- **Executive pressure**: Messages emphasizing confidentiality or discouraging consultation with colleagues are warning signs.
- **Timing tactics**: BEC attacks often occur during business trips or outside office hours when verification is more difficult.

## 4. Clone Phishing

Clone phishing involves creating nearly identical replicas of legitimate messages that victims have previously received, replacing authentic links or attachments with malicious ones.

### How It Works

Attackers gain access to or observe legitimate communications, then create virtually identical copies. They typically claim to be "updated" or "revised" versions of the original message, providing a plausible reason for the recipient to receive what appears to be a duplicate email.

### How to Spot Clone Phishing

- **Duplicate messages with slight differences**: Compare the new message with the original if available.
- **Unexpected updates**: Question why you're receiving an updated version of a message that didn't seem to require updating.
- **Different sender details**: The email address may be slightly different from the original sender.
- **Modified links or attachments**: Even if the message looks identical, the embedded links or attachments have been changed.

## 5. Smishing and Vishing (SMS and Voice Phishing)

As email security improves, attackers are increasingly turning to alternative channels like text messages (smishing) and phone calls (vishing) to conduct phishing attacks.

### How It Works

Smishing attacks use text messages containing malicious links or requesting sensitive information. Vishing attacks involve phone calls where attackers impersonate trusted entities like technical support, government agencies, or financial institutions to extract sensitive information or authentication codes.

### How to Spot Smishing and Vishing

- **Unexpected communications**: Be suspicious of unsolicited text messages or calls, especially those creating urgency.
- **Requests for personal information**: Legitimate organizations rarely request sensitive information via text or phone.
- **Suspicious links in texts**: Links in text messages should be treated with extreme caution.
- **Pressure tactics**: Attackers often use fear, urgency, or authority to pressure victims into acting quickly without verification.

## Building Organizational Defenses Against Phishing

While individual vigilance is crucial, organizations should implement multi-layered defenses against phishing:

1. **Regular security awareness training**: Conduct ongoing training with simulated phishing exercises to keep employees alert.
2. **Email filtering and authentication**: Implement robust email security solutions that filter suspicious messages and verify sender authenticity.
3. **Multi-factor authentication**: Require MFA for all accounts to prevent credential theft from resulting in account compromise.
4. **Clear reporting procedures**: Establish simple processes for employees to report suspicious communications.
5. **Verification protocols**: Implement verification procedures for sensitive requests, especially those involving financial transactions or credential changes.

## Conclusion

Phishing attacks continue to evolve in sophistication, but understanding the common types and their warning signs significantly improves your ability to detect and avoid them. By combining individual vigilance with organizational security measures, you can substantially reduce the risk of falling victim to these pervasive threats.

Remember: When in doubt, verify through official channels using contact information you know to be legitimate—not the information provided in the suspicious communication.
