## Answers

### Answer 1
**Phishing attempt**
- The sender domain (amazon-secure.net) is not an official Amazon domain
- The tracking link doesn't go to amazon.com
- Legitimate Amazon order emails include order details, not just a tracking link

### Answer 2
**Potentially phishing (requires verification)**
- While the email comes from a legitimate company domain, the request is unusual
- The lack of prior notification about payroll changes is suspicious
- Best practice: Contact HR directly through known channels to verify before taking action

### Answer 3
**Phishing attempt**
- Microsoft would never ask for your username and password via email
- The generic greeting ("Dear Customer") is a red flag
- Spelling and grammar errors are common in phishing emails
- Legitimate security alerts don't ask for credentials

### Answer 4
**Requires caution (potentially legitimate but verify)**
- The email comes from a legitimate Dropbox domain
- The link goes to the actual Dropbox website
- However, unexpected sharing notifications should be treated with caution
- Best practice: Contact the supposed sender through another channel to verify

### Answer 5
**Phishing attempt**
- Legitimate IT departments rarely send executable files via email
- The .exe file extension is a major red flag
- Security updates are typically deployed through managed systems, not email attachments

### Answer 6
**Likely legitimate**
- Consistent with regular LinkedIn communications
- Links go to legitimate LinkedIn domains
- Matches expected design and content
- Part of a regular pattern of communications you receive

### Answer 7
**Phishing attempt**
- The IRS never initiates contact via email about tax refunds
- The domain (irs-gov.org) is not the official IRS domain (irs.gov)
- Requesting SSN and banking details via email is a red flag
- The urgency and threat are classic phishing tactics

### Answer 8
**Potentially legitimate but verify independently**
- The email comes from your bank's domain
- The link goes to the secure bank website
- However, best practice is to navigate to your bank's website directly (not through the link) and check for any notifications there

### Answer 9
**Phishing attempt (CEO fraud/BEC scam)**
- Even though it appears to come from your CEO's email, the request is unusual
- Gift card requests are a common social engineering tactic
- The emphasis on confidentiality and urgency are red flags
- Best practice: Verify unusual requests via phone or in person

### Answer 10
**Potentially legitimate**
- The sender domain is correct for Google
- The content matches Google's typical security alerts
- The timing aligns with your recent activity
- However, it's still best to access your Google account directly (not through email links) to verify the alert

## Scoring
- 9-10 correct: Excellent! You're highly skilled at identifying phishing attempts.
- 7-8 correct: Good job! You can identify most phishing attempts but should remain vigilant.
- 5-6 correct: You have basic awareness but should review phishing indicators more carefully.
