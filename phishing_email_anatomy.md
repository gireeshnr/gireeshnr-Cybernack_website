# Anatomy of a Phishing Email: What to Look For

This infographic highlights the key elements to check when determining if an email is legitimate or a phishing attempt.

## Header Section
- **From Address**: Check for slight misspellings (microsoft-support.com vs. microsoft.com)
- **Reply-To**: May differ from the sender address - a red flag
- **Date/Time**: Unusual sending times (middle of the night) can indicate automated phishing campaigns

## Subject Line
- **Urgency**: "Immediate action required" or "Account suspension"
- **Curiosity**: "Your photo has been shared" or "See who viewed your profile"
- **Fear**: "Unauthorized login detected" or "Payment problem"
- **Reward**: "You've won!" or "Claim your gift card"

## Greeting
- **Generic**: "Dear Customer" or "Dear User" instead of your name
- **Overly Formal**: Unusually formal language for the supposed sender
- **Incorrect Information**: Wrong name or title

## Body Content
- **Grammar/Spelling**: Professional organizations rarely send emails with obvious errors
- **Inconsistent Formatting**: Mixed fonts, sizes, or colors
- **Requests for Personal Information**: Legitimate organizations don't ask for sensitive information via email
- **Mismatched URLs**: Text says one website but link goes to another
- **Suspicious Attachments**: Unexpected files, especially .exe, .zip, or .docm extensions

## Call to Action
- **Urgency**: "Within 24 hours" or "Immediately"
- **Threats**: "Or your account will be closed"
- **Unusual Processes**: Requests that bypass normal procedures
- **Suspicious Links**: URLs that don't match the legitimate company domain

## Footer
- **Missing Contact Information**: Legitimate businesses include contact details
- **Missing Legal Information**: No privacy policy or terms of service links
- **Poor Branding**: Logos that look slightly off or low-quality

## How to Verify
1. Hover over links (don't click) to see the actual URL
2. Contact the company directly using known contact information (not from the email)
3. Check for secure connections (https://) if you do visit websites
4. Use your company's phishing reporting tool to report suspicious emails

Remember: When in doubt, don't click, reply, or open attachments. Report the suspicious email to your IT security team.
