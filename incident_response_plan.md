| Low | Minimal impact, routine security events | Policy violations, minor issues | Within 48 hours |

## Incident Response Phases

### 1. Preparation
- Maintain current incident response plan
- Conduct regular training and simulations
- Establish and test communication channels
- Implement monitoring and detection tools
- Document system baselines and inventories

### 2. Detection and Analysis
- Identify potential security incidents
- Gather preliminary information
- Assess incident severity and classify
- Document initial findings
- Activate appropriate response team members

#### Initial Assessment Questions
- What systems and data are potentially affected?
- What is the potential business impact?
- Is the incident ongoing or contained?
- Is there evidence of data exfiltration?
- Are any critical services disrupted?
- What is the estimated scope of the incident?

### 3. Containment
- Implement short-term containment measures
  - Isolate affected systems
  - Block malicious IP addresses/domains
  - Disable compromised accounts
- Implement long-term containment
  - Apply emergency patches
  - Enhance monitoring
  - Implement additional security controls
- Preserve evidence for forensic analysis
  - Create system images
  - Capture logs and volatile data
  - Maintain chain of custody documentation

### 4. Eradication
- Identify and eliminate root cause
- Remove malware, backdoors, and artifacts
- Address vulnerabilities that were exploited
- Conduct security scans to verify eradication
- Implement additional security measures

### 5. Recovery
- Restore systems from clean backups
- Implement additional security controls
- Verify system functionality
- Monitor for signs of persistent threats
- Gradually return to normal operations
- Conduct vulnerability assessments before full restoration

### 6. Post-Incident Activities
- Conduct detailed post-incident analysis
- Document lessons learned
- Update incident response procedures
- Implement preventive measures
- Conduct additional training if needed
- Prepare final incident report

## Communication Plan

### Internal Communications
- Initial notification procedures
- Regular status updates (frequency based on severity)
- Escalation procedures
- Executive briefing templates
- Employee communications (if needed)

### External Communications
- Customer notification procedures
- Regulatory reporting requirements
- Law enforcement contact procedures
- Media response guidelines
- Partner/vendor communications

## Documentation Requirements

### Incident Documentation
- Incident timeline
- Actions taken
- Evidence collected
- Team members involved
- Impact assessment
- Root cause analysis
- Remediation steps

### Reporting Templates
- Initial incident report
- Status update template
- Executive summary template
- Final incident report template
- Regulatory notification templates

## Legal and Compliance Considerations
- Data breach notification requirements
- Evidence handling procedures
- Chain of custody documentation
- Regulatory reporting timelines
- Legal hold procedures

## Testing and Maintenance
- Annual plan review schedule
- Tabletop exercise schedule
- Full simulation exercise schedule
- Update procedures following incidents
- Training requirements for team members

## Appendices

### Contact Lists
- Incident response team
- Executive leadership
- External resources (consultants, forensic services)
- Law enforcement contacts
- Regulatory contacts

### Tools and Resources
- Security monitoring tools
- Forensic tools
- Communication platforms
- Documentation systems
- Evidence storage locations

### Reference Materials
- System architecture diagrams
- Network diagrams
- Data flow diagrams
- Asset inventory
- Backup schedules and procedures
