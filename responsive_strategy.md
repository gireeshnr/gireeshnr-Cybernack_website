# Cybernack Responsive Design Strategy

## Breakpoints
We will use the following breakpoints for responsive design:
- Mobile: 0-639px
- Tablet: 640px-1023px
- Desktop: 1024px and above

## Mobile-First Approach
- Start with mobile designs and scale up to larger screens
- Use fluid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- Ensure all interactive elements are touch-friendly with appropriate sizing

## Navigation
- Desktop: Full horizontal navigation menu
- Tablet: Full horizontal navigation menu or hamburger menu depending on space
- Mobile: Hamburger menu that expands to full-screen navigation

## Layout Adjustments
- Desktop: Multi-column layouts (2-4 columns depending on content)
- Tablet: Reduced columns (2 columns for most sections)
- Mobile: Single column layout for most sections

## Typography
- Responsive font sizes using relative units (rem)
- Base font size: 16px
- Headings scale proportionally across devices
- Line heights adjust for readability on smaller screens

## Images and Media
- Use responsive images with appropriate srcset attributes
- Optimize images for different screen sizes
- Consider different aspect ratios for hero images on mobile vs. desktop

## Interactive Elements
- Ensure buttons and form elements have minimum touch target size of 44px Ã— 44px
- Adjust hover states for touch devices
- Implement appropriate keyboard navigation for accessibility

## Subscription Cards
- Desktop: Side-by-side cards
- Tablet: Side-by-side cards with reduced padding
- Mobile: Stacked cards with full width

## Tables
- Desktop: Full tables with all columns
- Tablet: Scrollable tables or collapsed layout
- Mobile: Responsive tables that stack or allow horizontal scrolling

## Testing Strategy
- Test on actual devices when possible
- Use browser developer tools for simulated testing
- Check critical breakpoints and edge cases
- Ensure functionality works across all device sizes
